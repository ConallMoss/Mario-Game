## Mario-Game
Infinite Runner Style Mario game created for A-Level Computer Science Coursework, achieving a mark of 70/70

I created this project for my A-Level Coursework, where we had to create a project in a programming language of our choice and produce a full write up including Analysis, Design, Implemenation, Testing and Evaluation. 

# The Game
The aim of the game is to survive for as long as possible in an infinite scrolling world, in order to achieve a high a score as possible.
The game first consists of a login screen to log into your account (used for tracking each player's highscore). This then leads to a main menu screen, with options to play game, see how to play or quit the game. If the player chooses to play, they enter the game, where they may play until they die. This then leads them to a game over screen, which will take them back to the main menu screen.

# How it was made
The game was made using Python 3, with the graphics done using the Pygame library. I had just started learning about the Object-Oriented paradigm, so when building the project I tried to put some of those principles into practice.

This was my first big project, so taught me a lot about structuring code for maintainability, as well as using external libraries.
